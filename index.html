          <p>The dog is an extremely loyal creature. Having a dog as a pet provides us with a sense of <strong>delight and excitement.</strong>Almost everyone desires a cute puppy in his or her home.

  <p>The dogs require an open, clean, and safe environment in which to play and develop. They also require a nutritious food as well as access to clean water. 
It has the potential to keep them healthy and extend their lives. <em>A banded dog is more likely to be irritated and antisocial.</em> Most of the time, we have to let them go. 
Regular exercise and regular health visits are the most crucial things they can do to stay in shape. Their future is in our hands.</p>
